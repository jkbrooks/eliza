## Changes Made Based on Feedback

### Removed/Minimized:
- ~~Investment timeline and resource requirements~~ (moved to general phases)
- ~~Monetary ROI analysis~~ (replaced with outcomes and success metrics)
- ~~Detailed framework comparison matrix~~ (moved to appendix/competitive analysis)
- ~~Extensive technical specifications~~ (focused on strategic approach)
- ~~Resource allocation details~~ (kept general)

### Enhanced/Added:
- **Web3 competitive analysis** with actual GitHub repository research
- **Current branch analysis** (v3, streaming, tcm/tao branches)
- **Political context** and positioning considerations
- **Scenarios framework reference** for architecture limitations
- **TAU Bench integration difficulties** as concrete example
- **Expected outcomes and success metrics** instead of monetary ROI
- **Strategic positioning** for Python initiative within team dynamics

### Focused On:
- **The core suggestion**: Barbell strategy with Python sidekick → ElizaOS-Py
- **Immediate actionability**: Ultra-light integration as starting point
- **Strategic rationale**: Why this approach makes sense now
- **Clear value proposition**: What this achieves for ElizaOS

This revised structure focuses on selling the task we're proposing to work on with the group, with supporting research moved to appendices and competitive analysis documents.
